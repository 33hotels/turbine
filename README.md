## Getting started

### Installation
At the moment, Github is the only place to find Funnel. But we are looking into getting it to npm.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Funkia/funnel
```
Funnel uses two peer dependencies, that you'll need to install too:
* [hareactive](https://github.com/Funkia/hareactive) (Pure FRP library)
* [jabz](https://github.com/Funkia/jabz) (Monads, Do-notation and stuff)
```sh
npm install --save jabz hareactive
```
